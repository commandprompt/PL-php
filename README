PL/php 1.3 installation instructions.

You can always get the recent version of this document at:
http://projects.commandprompt.com/public/plphp/wiki/InstallDocs

Current PL/php release utilizes the GNU build system using autoconf/configure 
to detect system-specific features. To build PL/php you need PHP development 
package as well as PHP library (libphp.a or libphp.so). 

You can build static PHP library by doing make libphp5.so (in case of PHP5) and 
then copy the resulting library from .libs/libphp5.a to the lib subdirectory of 
the PHP installation path, which can be obtained by issuing:
	php-config --prefix 
If php-config --prefix tells that your PHP installation path is /usr/local/php5 
copy the library to the /usr/local/php5/lib. Or you can build PHP embed library 
by specifying --enable-embed option when configuring PHP. Apache's libphp.so is 
no longer supported. In some cases configure may fail to locate your PostgreSQL 
or PHP installation. You can use the following configure options to correct this 
(use configure --help to list all available configure options):

	--with-php=[DIR]
	    specify a path to the existing PHP installation 
		(configure searches for php-config in the specified DIR or DIR/bin) 
	--with-postgres=[DIR]
	    specify a path to the PostgreSQL installation 
		(configure looks for pg_config in the DIR or DIR/bin). 

Note that you need at least PostgreSQL 8.1 to use PL/php 1.3.2 and beyond. 
Current PL/php was tested with PostgreSQL 8.2/PHP 5.
