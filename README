PL/php Installation Procedure

You can always get the recent version of this document at:
https://public.commandprompt.com/projects/plphp/wiki/InstallDocs

Note that building against Apache's mod_php (libphp.so) is no longer supported.

The current PL/php release utilizes the GNU build system using
autoconf/configure to detect system-specific features.
If the configure program is not present (perhaps because you downloaded from
Subversion), you need to run

	autoconf

Use configure --help to list all the available options.

In some cases configure may fail to locate your PostgreSQL or PHP installation.
You can use the following configure options to correct this:

--with-php=PHPDIR::
       specify a path to the PHP installation (configure searches for
	php-config in PHPDIR or PHPDIR/bin)
 --with-postgres=PGDIR::
       specify a path to the PostgreSQL installation (configure looks for
	pg_config in PGDIR or PGDIR/bin).
Note 1: you need at least PostgreSQL 8.1 and PHP 5.

Note 2: you need GNU make to build PL/php. On systems where GNU make is not the
default make program (e.g. FreeBSD) you can usually invoke the GNU version with
gmake.

Building a suitable PHP installation
To build PL/php you need the PHP "embed" library (libphp5.so). To build and
install a shared PHP embed library, unpack the PHP tarball, change dir to the
PHP source dir and configure with the appropriate options:

	tar xfj php-5.2.6.tar.bz2
	cd php-5.2.6
	configure --enable-embed --prefix=/usr/local [--other-options]
	make install
You can, of course, use any other directory instead of /usr/local, but then you
need to make sure that the PostgreSQL server will be able to find the libraries
in there if you use something else (either by using LD_LIBRARY_PATH or by
adding it to /etc/ld.so.conf).

If it doesn't work
